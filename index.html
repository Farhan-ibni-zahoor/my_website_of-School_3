It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.

There is a vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for the speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.

		  <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

	   <p>It is a most exciting and challenging game generally played by two teams for the entertainment and enjoyment of the youths. Our school organized an Inter-school Football Tournament last Sunday. Games and sports are an integral part of education. One of the good sides of football is that it does not need a technical instrument before you can arrange and play football.Unlike other sports like basketball, lawn tennis, etc. Football is one of the most watched game in the history of the sporting world. Pupils are likely to be half a term behind other pupils who attend a school where there is little or no competition, such as those schools that are near local authority boundaries, they discovered. November 1997 Abstract I give an historic overview of education, competition, and competition within education, with an emphasis on computing science education. </p>

  	  <p>Science competitions are a great way to engage students, build on their practical skills and test their knowledge. Competition also teaches the importance of partaking, success and failure. This article lists ten competitions running in 2020/21 that students can enter virtually. You can also use the competition materials in your lessons, as homework, or as part of an extracurricular science club.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"><b>1. Accuracy</b>
                    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Economics</b>
                    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                    <br>
                   <b> 3. Productivity / Efficiency</b>
                    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
